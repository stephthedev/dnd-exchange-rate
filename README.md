# dnd-exchange-rate

A small javascript library to convert coins from Dungeons and Dragons 5e. 
See a working calculator [here](http://stephthedev.com/dnd-exchange-rate/).

## Overview
This library does two things:
* Converts lower value coins to higher value coins (i.e. coppers and silvers to gold)
* Evenly splits coins amongst a defined party size (i.e. (23 cp, 35 sp, 58 ep) split between 4 heroes)

## Building it
* `npm install`
* `npm test`	# Run tests
* `grunt`	# Bundle js scripts to dist/ directory


## Running it
Coming soon!
